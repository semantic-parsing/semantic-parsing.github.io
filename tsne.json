Abstract meaning representation (AMR) is a recent example of one such semantic formalism which, similar to a dependency parse, utilizes a graph to represent relationships between concepts (Banarescu et al., 2013). As with dependency parsing, transition-based approaches are a common approach to this problem. However, when trained in the traditional manner these systems are susceptible to the accumulation of errors when they find undesirable states during greedy decoding. Imitation learning algorithms have been shown to help these systems recover from such errors. To effectively use these methods for AMR parsing we find it highly beneficial to introduce two novel extensions: noise reduction and targeted exploration. The former mitigates the noise in the feature representation, a result of the complexity of the task. The latter targets the exploration steps of imitation learning towards areas which are likely to provide the most information in the context of a large action-space.

To this end, we first develop a novel componentwise beam search algorithm for relation identification in an incremental fashion, and then incorporate the decoder into a unified framework based on multiple-beam search, which allows for the bi-directional information flow between the two subtasks in a single incremental model. Experiments on the public datasets demonstrate that our joint model significantly outperforms the previous pipelined counterparts, and also achieves better or comparable performance than other approaches to AMR parsing, without utilizing external semantic resources.</p>\n", "tags": ["amr"], "tsne_embedding": [110.55671691894531, 164.2366943359375]}]
